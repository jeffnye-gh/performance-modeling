    - FIXME

- [riscv-software-src](https://github.com/riscv-software-src)
    - Umbrella repo maintained by RISC-V International (RVI)
    - Olympia is now part of this
 
- [riscv-software-src/Olympia](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-perf-model)
    - Olympia was part of Sparcians, new repo location
    - C++ performance model for example Out-of-order RISC-V
    - Trace driven, uses JSON or STF input
    - STF input can be generated by patching Dromajo

- [riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim)
    - Spike: official repo
    - Functional model, previously the golden reference
    - RVI says now replaced by Sail version

- [riscv-software-src/pk](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk)
    - Pico-Kernel
    - Provides minimal kernel for executing user mode code

- [riscv-software-src/riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests)
    - RVI compliance tests, asm fragments

- [riscv-software-src/semihosting](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-semihosting)
    - Semi-hosting - simulator to host communication
    - C/C++ std library access to native code execution

- [Sparta Docs](https://sparcians.github.io/map/index.html)
