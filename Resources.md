- [(r-s-s) riscv-software-src](https://github.com/riscv-software-src)
    - Umbrella repo maintained by RISC-V International (RVI)
    - Olympia is now part of this
 
- [r-s-s/Olympia](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-perf-model)
    - Olympia was part of Sparcians, new repo location
    - C++ performance model for example Out-of-order RISC-V
    - Trace driven, uses JSON or STF input
    - STF input can be generated by patching Dromajo
